                    The idea of integrating CQA system Askalot into edX was emerged at CSCW'15W, where the team mentor
                    Ivan Srba was presenting Askalot. He met there Joseph J. Wiliams from Standford University and
                    after a discussion they agreed that Askalot would be a great replacement for discussion system currently used in edX.
                    Afterwards the team AskEd was formed. It consists of six students and their mentor Ivan Srba.
                    Their goal is to integrate Askalot into edX system.
                </p>

                <h2>Askalot</h2>

                <p>
                    Askalot is a community question answering system that was developed by team naRuby as a part of
                    their team project in years 2013/2014, and it is currently used at Faculty of Informatics
                    and Information Technologies at Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. This project
                    also won the
                    <a href="http://www2.fiit.stuba.sk/~bielik/courses/tp-slov/tp-cup/index2014.html">TP CUP award</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Community question answering systems (CQA) are a popular part of the Web.
                    Among the well-known systems belong <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a>,
                    <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/">Wiki Answers</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.
                    Everyone, who has problems or unanswered questions can use these systems to ask new question, and
                    let the community to find the answer. Other users help to choose the best answer by voting on the answers
                    and or can post a new answer if no good answer is present. Once the user, who has asked the question, gets
                    satisfying answer, he/she can mark it as accepted. This provides other incomming users with additional 
                    information about the correct answer to that particular question. As the problems in human daily life repeat
                    it is much easier to find the answers to the most common questions thanks to CQA systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Askalot implements all main features of popular community question answering systems and extends
                    their functionality to support the education domain and its processes.
